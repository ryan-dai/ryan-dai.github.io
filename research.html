    <p> I consider myself a theorist, a modeler, and above all, a perpetual learner. I'm enchanted by the variety of ways that fundamental physical laws &#8212 fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and radiative transfer &#8212 can be blended to address complex problems in a hierarchy of models. Specifically, the central topics of my research have been the large-scale flows of atmosphere, ocean, and ice, as well as the dramatic climate changes in the past and at present.</p>
    <p> To gain a holistic understanding, I prefer a top-down, minimalist approach to attack any new problem, often starting from the simplest one of the climate model hierarchy &#8212 a single column radiative-convective model or one-dimensional energy balance model &#8212 to get a first-order grasp, and then moving to more complex, but still idealized GCMs to investigate the features that deem unrepresentable in a "lesser" model. A model would be made just as comprehensive as it needs to be to grasp the essence of the targeted problem, but is no more complex that elegance should be sacrificed for the sake of getting details right.</p>
